=============================
  check_po_file.py - README
=============================

This script checks PO files for (common) errors.
Some checks are FileZilla-specific.


Usage
=====

To check one or more PO files using the default checks, execute the script giving
the file name(s) as arguments::

  $ # Check de.po with default checks
  $ ./check_po_file.py de.po
  [...]

You can also enable all checks (add -a) or selectively enable (-e) or disable
(-d) only specific checks. -e and -d take the checks to enable/disable as a
list of characters::

  $ # Only check (-e) for mismatched trailing ellipses (i) and tab characters (t)
  $ ./check_po_file.py -eit de.po
  [...]

Call the script with -h to get a listing of options and available checks. Also
have a look at the checks' descriptions below.


Notes
=====

The checked PO files are assumed to be formatted correctly (msgfmt should be
able to compile them) and encoded in UTF-8. This also means that they must not
contain a byte order mark (BOM). In case a BOM is found, the respective file is
skipped; you can tell the script to temporarily ignore the BOM using a command
line option (-b).

Also note that the script uses some simplifications and *it is neither
guaranteed that all errors are caught nor that there are no false positives*.


Exit codes
==========

The following exit codes are used::

  0  No errors/findings or help/version information requested
  1  One or more file(s) could not be read
     and/or one or more file(s) were skipped due to parsing error or BOM found
     and/or one or more error(s) were found by the enabled checks
     and/or another error occured (wrong check IDs specified, ...)

Make sure to read the second note above if you want to base decisions on these
exit codes.


Available (types of) checks
===========================

Each check belongs to one of the following three types, influencing how
interesting items (e.g. format specifiers) found in the checked strings are
handled.


Types of checks
---------------

Check for mismatch of items (1):
  Extracts the items from both original string and translations and compares
  the items themselves as well as their order for all (original string,
  translated string) pairs.

Check for mismatch in number of items (2):
  Extracts the items from both original string and translations and compares
  the number of items found for all (original string, translated string) pairs.

Search for items (3):
  Searches the translations for specific items.

Note: (1) and (2) only use the singular form of the original string - its
plural form is ignored. (3) does not use the original string at all.


Currently available (partially FileZilla-specific) checks
---------------------------------------------------------

For a short list see the script's help output.

In the following list of descriptions, the character in square brackets is the
respective check's ID which can be used with the -e or -d options; "Default"
specifies if the check is enabled by default.


[a] mismatched keyboard accelerators (&<non-&/whitespace character>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:Type:    Check for mismatch in number of items
:Default: No

Checks if there is the same number of keyboard accelerators in both original
string and translation. All combinations of ampersand (&) and
non-ampersand/non-whitespace character are counted as a keyboard accelerator
item.

Mismatches should be fixed.

Example::

 de.po: -- Potential mismatch: too few keyboard accelerators - expected 1, got 0
 de.po:227: msgid "&Account:"
 de.po:228: msgstr "Konto:"


[e] mismatched escape sequences (\\n, \\r, \\t, \\\\)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. Note: Backslashes in the above heading and the following paragraph are
   escaped to get proper reStructuredText markup (e.g. \\n actually means \n in
   context of this README).

:Type:    Check for mismatch of items
:Default: No

Compares the escape sequences found in the original string (only \\n, \\r, \\t
and \\\\ are searched for) with the ones from the translation (taking item
order into account).

Mismatches in general should be fixed; if the original string does not contain
any linebreak escape sequences, but the translation does, this mismatch must be
fixed.

Example::

 de.po: -- Potential mismatch: too few escape sequences - expected ["\n"], got []
 de.po:5326: msgid "Please enter raw FTP command.\nUsing raw ftp commands will clear the directory cache."
 de.po:5329: msgstr "Bitte geben Sie einen FTP-Befehl ein. Die Benutzung eigener FTP-Befehle leert den Verzeichniscache."


[f] mismatched format specifiers (%<arbitrary character>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:Type:    Check for mismatch of items
:Default: Yes

Compares the format specifiers from the original string with the ones found in
the translation (item order is taken into account). All combinations of percent
character (%) and an arbitrary following character are interpreted as format
specifier by this check.

Mismatches must be fixed with the exception of "format specifiers" which are
actually not interpreted as such (see below for an example).
Note: A (missing) c-format flag (e.g. "#, c-format") is no definitive indicator
if a string actually is a format string or not. [1]_

Example (must be fixed)::

 de.po: -- Potential mismatch: unexpected format specifier(s) - expected ["%d", "%s"], got ["%s", "%d"]
 de.po:68: msgid "%d file. Total size: %s"
 de.po:70: msgstr[0] "%s Datei. Gesamtgröße: %d"

Example (allowed)::

 de.po: -- Potential mismatch: unexpected format specifier(s) - expected ["%Y", "%m", "%d"], got ["%d", "%m", "%Y"]
 de.po:1076: msgid "(example: %Y-%m-%d)"
 de.po:1077: msgstr "(Beispiel: %d.%m.%Y)"


[i] mismatched trailing ellipses (..., <ellipsis>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:Type:    Check for mismatch in number of items
:Default: No

Checks that a translation contains a trailing ellipsis if the original string
does contain one. Both three dots ("...") or an ellipsis character ("…") may be
used, even if the original string uses the three-dots variant.

Mismatches should be fixed.

Example::

 de.po: -- Potential mismatch: too few trailing ellipses - expected 1, got 0
 de.po:441: msgid "&Download..."
 de.po:442: msgstr "&Herunterladen"


[l] space-linebreak escape sequence combinations ( <\\n or \\r>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. Note: Backslashes in the above heading and the following paragraph are
   escaped to get proper reStructuredText markup (e.g. \\n actually means \n in
   context of this README).

:Type:    Search for items
:Default: Yes

Searches the translations for combinations of a space character and a linebreak
escape sequence (\\n, \\r).

Any findings must be fixed, for example by removing the space character (if
applicable).

Example::

 de.po: -- Found space-linebreak escape sequence combination(s): [" \n"]
 de.po:3232: msgid "Enter the port on which the server listens.\nThe default for FTP is 21, the default for SFTP is 22."
 de.po:3235: msgstr "Geben Sie die Portnummer des Servers an. \nDer Standardport für FTP ist 21, der Standardport für SFTP ist 22."


[s] double spaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:Type:    Search for items
:Default: Yes

Finds double (and also triple, ...) spaces in the translations.

Any occurrence of double spaces must be fixed (only single spaces are allowed).

Example::

 de.po: -- Found double space(s): ["  "]
 de.po:1068: msgid "(At least 7 days)"
 de.po:1069: msgstr "(Mindestens  7 Tage)"


[t] tab characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:Type:    Search for items
:Default: No

Searches the translations for tab characters.

Any tab characters found must be removed.

Example::

 de.po: -- Found tab character(s): ["    "]
 de.po:1297: msgid "About FileZilla"
 de.po:1298: msgstr "Über        FileZilla"


[w] mismatched leading/trailing whitespace (space, tab)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:Type:    Check for mismatch of items
:Default: No

Checks that the translation does only contain leading or trailing whitespace if
the original string does so, too.

Any mismatches must be fixed.

Example::

 de.po: -- Potential mismatch: too many occurrences of leading/trailing whitespace - expected [], got [" "]
 de.po:1325: msgid "Action to perform:"
 de.po:1326: msgstr "Durchzuführende Aktion: "
